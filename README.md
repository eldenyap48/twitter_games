## Introduction
- 

## Requirements

- A default file, `chartjs-chart-financial.js`, from `chartjs` is included in the static folder. It is essential for generating the candlestick chart.

## Why did I make this app?
As an amateur investor, I often find many of the online investing analysis platforms complicated, inflexible and convoluted. In light of this, InvestingTool serves as a user-friendly alternative for anybody to freely analyse their stocks, while also allowing investors to connect and share with one another. It has a huge potential for expansion too; with further enhancements, I'm sure it can help many new investors.
